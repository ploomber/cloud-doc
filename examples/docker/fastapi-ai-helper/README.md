# About this application

This is an LLM-based API with a focus on helping you answer questions about orders. ðŸš€

## How it works

This API uses the  Haystack (https://haystack.deepset.ai/overview/intro) framework to build a 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that can answer questions about orders. 
The pipeline is initialized with a document store that contains information about orders.
The pipeline uses the document store to answer questions about orders.

The API is built with FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance),
web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

It is deployed on  Ploomber Cloud (https://ploomber.io/), a platform for building and deploying
Python data and AI-based apps.
