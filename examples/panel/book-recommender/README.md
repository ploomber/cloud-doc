## Set key

To run this example you need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key> 
```

## Dataset

Download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristaliss/ultimate-book-collection-top-100-books-up-to-2023) to the `book-recommender/` folder, and rename it as `goodreads.csv`. 


## Generate lookup files

Generate lookup files by running the following script:

```bash
python generate_assets.py --embeddings --verbose
```

Running this command should generate `author_to_title.json`, `title_to_description.json` and `embeddings.json` files in the `assets/` folder.

If you want to generate embedding for the first N rows only run the below command (here N=100):

```bash
python generate_assets.py -n 100 --embeddings --verbose
```

## Weights and biases tracking

This application comes with weights and biases tracking. It is disabled by default. To enable it, go to `app.py` and set `WEIGHTS_AND_BIASES_TRACKING` = True.

You will also need to create an account in Weights and Biases. You can do this by visiting the [Weights and Biases website sign up page - it's free](https://wandb.ai/site/). You will need to generate an API key, which you can obtain after you log in by visiting [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize). 

Once you log in, you can create a new project by visiting your user profile, selecting the project tab, and clicking on the "New Project" button.

The app assumes the following environment variable names. Please store them somewhere safe, as you will need them later. You can set them as environment variables, or create a `.env` file with these values.

```bash
WANDB_API_KEY=your_api_key
WANDB_PROJECT=your_project_name
WANDB_ENTITY=your_user_name
```

Now, just run your app and then navigate to the project page. You should see logs tracking the responses of your app.

## Deployment

Create a zip of `app.py`, `util.py`, `_wandb.py`, `requirements.txt` and `assets/` folder, and follow the instructions for deploying a [Panel](https://docs.cloud.ploomber.io/en/latest/apps/panel.html) application.
You also need to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an [environment variable](https://docs.cloud.ploomber.io/en/latest/user-guide/secrets.html) while deploying the application. If you have Weights and Biases tracking enabled, make sure you set those environment values as well.
