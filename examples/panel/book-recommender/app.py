"""
Chat application for recommending books to the user.

Input:
User can submit queries that describe the type of books they are looking for, e.g., suggest fiction novels.
Users can also ask the chat assistant for books by specific author, e.g., recommend books by Dan Brown.
Answers to user's queries will be based on the Goodreads dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cristaliss/ultimate-book-collection-top-100-books-up-to-2023

Application logic:
The app determines the closest matches by comparing user query's embedding to the available
book embeddings. Embeddings of books are pre-computed on the description column of every book
and stored in the assets/ folder.

Response:
The chat assistant then determines the top relevant answers shortlisted by comparing embeddings and
provides the top 5 recommendations.
