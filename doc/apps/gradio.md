# Gradio

To deploy a Gradio application in Ploomber Cloud you need:

- A [Ploomber Cloud](https://platform.ploomber.io/register?utm_source=gradio&utm_medium=documentation) account
- A `Dockerfile`
- Your code

## `Dockerfile`

You need to provide a `Dockerfile`, you can use this [template](https://github.com/ploomber/doc/blob/main/examples/gradio/basic-app/Dockerfile) to get started. The template contains the minimal steps needed for a deployment but you need to modify so it installs any required dependencies and copies your code into the Docker image.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11

COPY app.py app.py
RUN pip install gradio

ENV GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=80
ENV GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0

ENTRYPOINT ["gradio", "app.py"]
```

## Testing locally

To test your app, you can use `docker` locally:

```sh
# build the docker image
docker build . -t gradio

# run it
docker run -p 5000:80 gradio
```

Now, open [http://0.0.0.0:5000/](http://0.0.0.0:5000/) to see your app.


## Deploy

Once you have all your files, create a zip file.

To deploy a Gradio app from the deployment menu, follow these instructions:

To ensure your app doesn't break on re-deployments, pin your [dependencies.](pin-dependencies)
