# GPUs

```{note}
For GPUs email us at
[contact@ploomber.io](mailto:contact@ploomber.io) to get access.
```

To deploy a GPU, first, [create an account](https://platform.ploomber.io/register?utm_source=gpu&utm_medium=documentation). Then, select the `Docker` option:

In the `Source code` section, drop a `.zip` file with your code. Or use one of the examples (download them and zip them):

::::{grid} 2 2 3 3
:class-container: text-center
:gutter: 2

:::{grid-item-card} üåî Image Q&A

Then, in the deployment form, select `1 GPU` in the `Advanced` section:

Currently, only `1 GPU` is supported, which will deploy your application on a
machine with an NVIDIA T4 (16GB), 4 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM.

## Using the CLI

You can also deploy your project with a GPU using the command-line interface. Set your API key and initialize your project:

```sh
ploomber-cloud key YOURKEY
ploomber-cloud init
```

Now, configure your resources:

```sh
ploomber-cloud resources
```

When you select `1 GPU`, CPU and RAM are fixed at `4 CPUs` and `16 GB RAM`.

Finally deploy your project:

```sh
ploomber-cloud deploy --watch
```
