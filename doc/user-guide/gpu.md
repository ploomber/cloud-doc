# GPUs

```{note}
We're giving way free GPUs for a week to test our system. Email us at
[contact@ploomber.io](mailto:contact@ploomber.io) if you want access.
```

To deploy a GPU, first, [create an account](https://platform.ploomber.io/register?utm_source=gpu&utm_medium=documentation). Then, select the `Docker` option:

In the `Source code` section, drop a `.zip` file with your code. Or use one of the examples (download them and zip them):

machine with an NVIDIA T4 (16GB), 4 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM.
